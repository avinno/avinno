## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aaron. I have been designing for the web for over 15 years and I have been developing for the web for over 5 years.

This repo is for any ideas I have for web-related projects/products, no matter how crazy or wild they are, to push the bar in various areas of web design and development. And best of all, I get to share it with you all!
