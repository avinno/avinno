## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aaron. I have been designing for the web for over 15 years and I have been developing for the web for over 5 years.

This GitHub account is for any ideas I have for web-related projects/products, no matter how crazy or wild they are, to push the bar in various areas of web design and development and to try new ways of doing things as tech continues to make quick advances. And best of all, I get to share it all with you all! Hopefully these projects won't turn out to be too much of a "shit show", but let's have some fun!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new portfolio revamp and a new business page/app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build and use my own custom API's.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on client work, fun/friend projects, open source projects, and any ideas someone might have who would love to discuss it.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding someone who would be interested in stepping in as back-end developer for my agency with the expectation of a long-term, yet flexible, working relationship.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ANYTHING!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: hello@avweb.io
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a twin.
